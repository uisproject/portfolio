          At the year of 2018 I applied into Bina Nusantara University to study more
          about tech industry such as how to make a diagram before making an application,
          analyzing documents, requirements gathering and also develop some programs.
          Not to mention that I also like to do my own research about tech from Youtube,
          Udemy, Stackoverflow, etc.

          <br /><br />

          My current focus is to create awesome product using my skill i've
          learnt so far and becoming better and better😁.
